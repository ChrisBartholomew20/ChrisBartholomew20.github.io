    <h2>What is HelpHub</h2>
    <p>This is a website that unites passionate volunteers with local charities. It is a platform of interaction, generosity, and community engagement. We strive to bring people together and unite them in supporting a common cause.</p>

    <h2>Our Mission:</h2>
    <p>Create a hub where people can find ways to help their community. In our society, we suffer from an information overload with how many resources are available to us. Everywhere you look, there are different charities asking for donations. Our goal is to allow you to easily see and access nearby charities.</p>
